# ScrobblePod

ScrobblePod is a music scrobbler for Last.fm. It manages every song you play in iTunes, iPod and iPhone.

When you listen to music on your iPod and in iTunes, songs are often scrobbled in the wrong order. ScrobblePod fixes this by queueing your songs for scrobbling, until your iPod is plugged in.

### Big impact with a small footprint
The point of Last.fm is to track what you listen to, so it makes sense to ensure that none of your songs are ignored. ScrobblePod does this without making a fuss, sitting out of your way in the menu bar. No artist charts or confusing messages, just the clean interface that you have come to love on your Mac.

### Easy on the eyes
With it's scrolling song display and subtle animations, ScrobblePod makes it painless to perform song-related actions.

### Love it or Hate it
Want to let the world know what you think of a song? Fire up ScrobblePod and choose between Love, Ban, Tag and Share. With a single click, shape your Last.fm profile around your own personal tastes. 

### What you want, when you want it
ScrobblePod gives you full control over your Last.fm account. Want to keep that CÃ©line Dion song a secret? Not a problem, just give it a comment in iTunes. 
You can also control exactly when your songs are scrobbled. Switch scrobbling on and off whenever you like, or just let ScrobblePod manage it automatically.
